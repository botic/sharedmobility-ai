## DataSet Producer

The dataset producer exports the <abbr title="SharedMobility.ai">SMAI</abbr> database
into separate CSV files. These files can be used directly as input datasets by TensorFlow / Keras:

#### JavaScript / TensorFlow.js
```javascript
const DATA_URL = "https://storage.googleapis.com/smai-public-datasets/citybikewien/fullrange/service_2-2019-05-07_2019-07-31.csv";
const csvDataset = await tf.data.csv(DATA_URL);
```

#### Python
````python
TRAIN_DATA_URL = "https://storage.googleapis.com/smai-public-datasets/citybikewien/fullrange/service_2-2019-05-07_2019-07-31.csv"
train_file_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file("train.csv", TRAIN_DATA_URL)
````

### Get the Data

You find a set of already exported data set in our public Google Cloud Storage bucket:

[https://storage.googleapis.com/smai-public-datasets/][BUCKET]

* [Full export CSV][FULL] for Citybike Wien from 2019-05-07 to 2019-07-31
* [Only station CSV][ONESTATION] for Citybike Wien's station at KÃ¤rtner Ring / Vienna Opera from 2019-05-07 to 2019-07-31

### Known Issues

* The `<start-date>` and `<end-date>` are not in UTC, but in the time zone defined by the config's `timeZone` property.
  This is because all current SMAI stations are located in `Europe/Vienna`. If you want to use the producer outside the
  central European time zone, you should change this to `UTC` or your local time zone.
* You cannot configure the CSV format. We use standard CSV with `,` as a delimiter and `\r\n` as line separator.
