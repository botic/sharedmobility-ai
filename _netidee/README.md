# What do we do?

SharedMobility.ai removes customer frustration from shared mobility services.
We saw the rise of shared mobility services in the last years. Most of the newcomers are free-floating shared-use systems.
These systems operate on a data-driven approach and try to reach profitability by optimizing their fleets.
Station-based solutions need enhancements by smart data-driven technologies to keep pace with their new competitors.
SharedMobility.ai is an Open Source approach to provide simple smart features to existing station-based services.
